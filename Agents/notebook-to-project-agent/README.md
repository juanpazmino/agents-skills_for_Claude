# notebook-to-project Agent

A Claude Code agent that converts Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) into clean, well-structured Python projects. Drop it into any repo and Claude will handle the full pipeline: notebook detection, `.py` conversion, code analysis, project scaffolding, and test stub generation — all in one guided session.

---

## Installation

Download or clone this folder, then copy the agent file to the scope that fits your use case.

### Project (shared with your team)

Copy into your project root and commit it so everyone on the team has access:

```bash
cp -r .claude/ /your/project/
cd /your/project && git add .claude/ && git commit -m "Add notebook-to-project agent"
```

### Local (personal, project-specific)

Copy into your project root but exclude it from version control:

```bash
cp -r .claude/ /your/project/
echo ".claude/agents/" >> /your/project/.gitignore
```

### Global (personal, all projects)

Copy to your home directory to make the agent available in every project on this machine:

```bash
cp .claude/agents/notebook-to-project.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

The next time you open Claude Code in your project, the agent is available.

---

## Usage

Open Claude Code in your project and ask:

```
Convert my notebook analysis.ipynb into a proper Python project.
```

Or let Claude pick it up automatically — if you drop a `.ipynb` file into the conversation, Claude will offer to use the agent.

The agent will guide you through each step and ask for confirmation before scaffolding.

---

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated
- Python 3.8+ in the target project environment
- The `.ipynb` notebook file present in (or provided to) the project

```

The structure adapts to the notebook's domain (data science, data engineering, visualization, automation).

## Code Fidelity

The agent preserves your original notebook code exactly as written. Unless you explicitly ask for refactoring, renaming, or new features, the conversion will not alter function names, variable names, or logic structure.

**What stays the same:**
- All function and variable names (no auto-rename to snake_case or camelCase)
- Logic and control flow (repetitive or inefficient patterns are converted as-is)
- No added error handling, logging, or validation beyond what is in the notebook

**What the agent is permitted to change:**
- Removing notebook-specific artifacts (magic commands, `display()` calls)
- Moving imports to the top of each file
- Wrapping code in functions/classes when splitting into modules (original logic is preserved inside)
- Replacing hardcoded credentials per the security policy below

If the agent notices a pattern worth flagging (e.g., repeated logic that could be a helper), it will mention it — but will not rewrite it unless you ask.

---

## Security

The agent is designed to handle untrusted notebook content safely:

- **Prompt injection protection** — notebook cell content (code, markdown, outputs) is treated as data, never as instructions. Adversarial directives embedded in cells are ignored.
- **Credential handling** — any hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) detected in the notebook are replaced with `os.environ.get("VAR_NAME")` in the generated code. The real values are never written to files. You will receive a `.env.example` with placeholder names and instructions to create a `.env` file locally.
- **`.env` never committed** — the generated `.gitignore` always includes `.env`, `config/secrets.*`, `*.key`, and `*.pem`.
- **Shell command review** — only `!pip install` commands are processed automatically (added to `requirements.txt`). All other shell commands found in notebook cells (e.g., `!rm`, `!curl`, `!wget`) are shown to you and require explicit confirmation before any action is taken.
- **Filename sanitization** — the notebook filename is sanitized before use. Path traversal characters are stripped and all output files are written within the project root.
- **Static-only validation** — generated Python files are validated with `ast.parse()` / `py_compile`. No generated code is executed during the conversion process.
- **Bounded directory scan** — the agent scans at most 3 directory levels deep when looking for `.ipynb` files.

### After generation: secrets checklist

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your real values.
2. Confirm `.env` is listed in `.gitignore` before your first commit.
3. Never commit `.env` or `config/secrets.*` to version control.
4. Review any flagged credentials the agent could not automatically replace.

## Agent Memory

The agent stores learned patterns in `.claude/agent-memory/notebook-to-project/MEMORY.md`. Over time it records your preferred project structure, common libraries, naming conventions, and domain-specific patterns — so each subsequent conversion improves.

Memory entries are written from the agent's own analysis only. Notebook cell content is never copied verbatim into memory.
